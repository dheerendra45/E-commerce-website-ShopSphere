# E-Commerce Web Application

## Overview

This is a full-fledged **E-Commerce Web Application** that allows users to browse products, add items to the cart, search and filter products, manage their profiles, and make purchases. The app features an **Admin Dashboard** for managing products, categories, and user data. It also includes **JWT-based Authentication** for secure login, and different access rights for **Admin** and **User** roles. Additionally, we're integrating **Customer Support** functionality by creating a custom **AI-powered chatbot** to assist users.

The app is built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), ensuring fast, responsive, and scalable user experiences.
